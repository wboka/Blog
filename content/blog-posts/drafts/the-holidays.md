# Sacrifice

In the coming weeks and months, we are going to be facing some tough decisions. Do we get together with our extended families or stay on the path of isolation? There is no easy answer. Families are being figuratively torn apart by the impossible and once in a lifetime crisis. Kids want to hug their grandparents. Parents want some time away from the kids. People just want a break because this is hard. It's hard to be hopeful for the end of this when too many people aren't taking this threat seriously.

We will come out of this at some point. It's not a matter of if but when. Some families will be forever changed. Few will be lucky enough enough to have been stable throughout this ordeal. At the time of writing this my home state of Pennsylvania has lost 9,465 people due to COVID-19 related symptoms. Cameron and Sullivan County is Pennsylvania have an estimated combined population of 10,169. Forest County has an estimated population of 7,215. Imagine if they were just gone.
